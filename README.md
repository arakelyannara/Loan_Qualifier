# Loan qualifier application

This is a python command-line interface application that allows users 
to see qualifying loans from lenders quickly and easily. 
The application works by taking in a CSV file to calculate 
and filter qualifying loans based on a number of questions asked 
to a user to evaluate a list of qualifying loans and saves 
the qualifying loans in a user-defined file.
